## Informations

To develop this portfolio, I used the React framework. I installed it via Vite for easier and faster installation.

I use ThreeJS for my 3d logo on the homepage, which I created and exported to Spline, a 3d modeling tool.

If you have any problems on this site, please let me know by contacting me by email.
